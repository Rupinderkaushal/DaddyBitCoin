               <p>
               Daddy Bitcoin is an increase or decrease in the total supply of a <br/> given token across all
                holding pools and all wallets. This is done in <br/> order to adjust the token price, without 
                affecting the value of <br/> anyoneâ€™s share of coins.
               </p>
           </div>
           <div className='para-div'>
               <p>
               This can be beneficial as the chart will always look healthy <br/> regardless of dips and we can be
                on the top gainers parts of <br/> websites due to the illusion of a rise in price floor so is a <br/>
                 brilliant marketing tool in itself.
